My portfolio ProjectüòÅ

I Decided to develop a Local Job Portal that connects local Job seekers an Local employers.

Name: Harry Macharia Muriithi.

Role: Full-Stack Developer, Project Manager.

Reason: As the only team member, I will take on both technical and project management responsibilities. My role as a full-stack developer will involve designing, implementing, and maintaining the front-end and back-end components of the local job portal. As the project manager, I will oversee the entire project, including planning, setting goals, scheduling, and ensuring all aspects of the project are on track.

Problem the Portfolio Project is Intended to Solve:

The Portfolio Project aims to address the challenge of local unemployment and job search by providing a platform for local job seekers and employers to connect efficiently. It seeks to simplify the process of finding and posting local job opportunities, thereby reducing the unemployment rate and helping local businesses find suitable candidates.

Who the Portfolio Project Will Help and/or Who the Users Will Be:
	1. Local Job Seekers: This platform will serve as a valuable resource for individuals actively seeking employment opportunities within a specific locality. Job seekers can create profiles, browse local job listings, and apply for positions that match their skills and preferences.
	2. Local Employers: Local businesses, companies, and organizations will be able to use the platform to post job openings, review applications, and connect with potential candidates. This helps local employers find talent that is well-suited for their specific needs.

Relevance to a Specific Locale: Yes, the Portfolio Project is highly relevant to a specific locale or geographic region. It is designed to focus on job opportunities and candidates within a particular area, making it particularly valuable for local job markets.

Decision to Reimplement form existing platforms:
The decision to reimplement a local job portal is based on the need for a specialized solution that addresses the unique requirements of local job markets. While existing platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor offer valuable services, they are designed for broader audiences and do not provide the depth of localization and community-building that a local job portal can offer.
